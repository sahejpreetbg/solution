    <br>
    Subject: Requesting letter to start Yoga Classes in our School. <br>
    <br>
    Respected Sir,<br> 
    
     It is with a deep sense of concern that, on behalf of the student board, I am writing this letter to highlight<br>
      the importance of starting Yoga classes in our school. 
    <br>
     <br>
     Yoga in Daily Life is a system of practice consisting of eight levels of development in the areas of physical<br>,
      mental, social and spiritual health.When the body is physically healthy, the mind is clear, focused and stress is<br>
       under control. This gives the space to connect with loved ones and maintain socially healthy relationships. When you<br>
        are healthy you are in touch with your inner Self, with others and your surroundings on a much deeper level, which adds<br>
         to your spiritual health.The word “Yoga” originates from Sanskrit and means “to join, to unite”. Yoga exercises have a holistic <br>
         effect and bring  body, mind, consciousness and soul into  balance.  The main goals  of  “Yoga  in  Daily  Life”  are  Physical Health<br>
         ,  Mental Health, Social Health,  Spiritual Health, Self-Realization or realization of the Divine within us. These goals are attained <br>
         by Love and  help  for  all  living  beings,Respect  for  life,  protection of  nature  and  the environment,A peaceful  state of  mind,<br>
          Full vegetarian  diet,  Pure thoughts  and  positive  lifestyle,  Physical, mental  and  spiritual  practices,  Tolerance  for  all <br>
           nations,  cultures  and  religions.  Yogic techniques are  known  to  improve  one’s overall  performance.  Pranayama is an important,<br>
            yet little known part  of Yoga. Until  recently, this art  and science of yogic  breathing was almost completely  unknown  to  the  common <br>
             man  like  many  other  ancient  Indian  arts.Pranayama techniques act to purify the nadis including these three main energy channels.
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
             Healthy society at Dharavi Street is offering Yoga classes for all with special batches<br>
              for students at reasonable fees. It is our humble request that you request them to start <br>

              <br> classes in our esteemed school so that many students can avail of this opportunity and benefit from it. We are confident that you will accept our request.

<h2>Expansion of an Idea :-</h2>
<h>Cleanliness is Next to Godliness.</h>

<p> Cleanliness is next to godliness is a most common and famous proverb which means cleanliness is<br>
     everything for the goodness. People should keep themselves clean and bright to maintain their <br>
     healthy life style and healthy living. Cleanliness is way to godliness and godliness is way to <br>
     balance mind, soul and body. Being clean is the mean to keep ourselves physically and mentally clean.<br>
      Keeping our body clean, tidy and well dressed makes us smart enough to get confidence and positive thoughts.<br>
       Clean habits with nice dress sense creates good impression on others and good reputation in the society because <br>
       cleanliness reflects a clean character of the person.<br>
       <br>

    It is considered that the people maintaining cleanliness and develop the habit of dressing smartly,<br> 
    become clean character and generally pious and god-fearing. Such people have certain morals in their<br>
     life and have clean heart by being godly. We can say that godliness starts with clean heart and clean heart <br>
     can be of person with good character. This is the reason why priests of any religion tell to be clean from body and <br>
     mind before worship. Cleanliness is the first and foremost thing to be near to the god.<br>
     <br>
    
    On the other hand, being clean strengthens our immunity system and secures us from many chronic and <br>
    acute diseases. However, clean people may catch diseases from dirty people but they are strong enough<br>
     to tackle small problems. They can manage things in their surroundings related to the cleanliness including <br>
     instructing poor and dirty people about cleanliness.<br>
     <br>
    
    People maintaining their proper cleanliness feel shame in meeting with the people having dirty face, <br>
    hands, soiled clothes and bad smelling clothes because they feel their insult while meeting with such type <br>
    of people. Cleanliness of body is really very necessary for the good physical health. On the other hand, physical<br>
     cleanliness gives inner cleanliness and keeps heart and mind clean. Cleanliness of mind keeps us mentally healthy and<br>
      prevents from the psychological problems. So, the complete cleanliness keeps away from dirt and diseases as both go together,<br>
       where there is dirt there is diseases.
    <br>
    <br>

    Disease causing germs breed and grow very rapidly in the dirt which causes infection or various epidemic <br>diseases such as cholera.<br>
     So, in order to be healthy, happy and a peaceful life we all should practice clean habits in every aspect of life because dirt symbolizes<br>
      moral evil whereas cleanliness symbolizes moral purity.
