<h2>1) Explain architecture of computer</h2>

<div class="row">
  <div class="column" style="background-color:white;">
    <p>In computer engineering, computer architecture is a set of rules and methods <br>
	that describe the functionality, organization, and implementation of computer systems.<br>
	The architecture of a system refers to its structure in terms of separately specified<br>
	components of that system and their interrelationships.
	<br>
	<br>

Some definitions of architecture define it as describing the capabilities and <br>
programming model of a computer but not a particular implementation. In other<br>
 definitions computer architecture involves instruction set architecture design,<br>
 microarchitecture design, logic design, and implementation</p>

<h1>2) what is a storage unit ? Explain types of primary memory storage</h1>
<p>A storage unit is a part of the computer system which is employed to store the<br>
 information and instructions to be processed. A storage device is an integral part of the <br>
 computer hardware which stores information/data to process the result of any computational work.<br>
 The two main types of primary storage are ROM, which is non-volatile , and RAM, which is volatile .<br>
 Non-volatile memory keeps its contents even when the computer is switched off. Volatile memory loses its<br>
 contents when power is lost.</p> <img src="input image.png" width="400" height="150">

<h1>3) write down the difference between LAN, MAN and WAN</h1>
<p>LAN is a network that usually connects a small group of computers in a given geographical<br>
 area. MAN is a comparatively wider network that covers large regions- like towns, cities, etc.<br>
 The WAN network spans to an even larger locality. It has the capacity to connect various countries together<br>.</p>
 
<h1>4) Explain functional units of a computer system</h1>
 <p>The input unit takes the input, the central processing unit does the processing of data and the output unit produces the output<br>
 . The memory unit holds the data and instructions during the processing</p>
<h1>5) Explain recent trends in IT</h1>
<h1>1. Computing Power </h1>
<p>Computing power has already established its place in the digital era, with almost every device and<br>
 appliance being computerized. And it’s here for even more as data science experts have predicted that the<br>
 computing infrastructure we are building right now will only evolve for the better in the coming years.<br>
 At the same time, we have 5G already; gear up for an era of 6G with more power in our hands and devices<br>
 surrounding us. Even better, computing power is generating more tech jobs in the industry but would require<br>
 specialized qualifications for candidates to acquire. From data science to robotics and IT management, this field <br>
 will power the largest percentage of employment in every country. The more computing our devices will need, the more <br>
 technicians, IT teams, relationship managers, and the customer care economy will flourish.<br><br>

One essential branch under this field that you can learn today is RPA, i.e. Robotic Process Automation. At Simplilearn, RPA<br>
 is all about computing and automation software that can train you for a high-paying role in the IT industry. Here are the <br>
 top jobs you can target after RPA: </p>
 
 <h1>2. Smarter Devices </h1>
<p>Artificial intelligence has played an essential role in making our world smarter and smoother.<br>
 It is not just simulating humans but going the extra mile to make our life hassle-free and simpler.<br>
 These smarter devices are here to stay in 2023 and even further, as data scientists are working on AI  <br>
 home robots, appliances, work devices, wearables, and so much more! Almost every job needs smart software<br>
 applications to make our work life more manageable. Smarter devices are another addition to the IT industry<br>
 that is of high requirement and demand as more companies transform into digital spaces. Almost every higher-level<br>
 job requires a good proficiency in IT and automation these days to thrive. This is why Simplilearn’s RPA course can<br>
 help you master these skills to achieve par excellence in your career, whether in IT, marketing, or management.<br>
 Here are the best jobs you can venture:</p>

<h1>Tutorial -02<h1>

<h1>1) what is database?</h1>
<p>A database is an organized collection of structured information, or data, typically stored electronically in a computer system.<br>
 A database is usually controlled by a database management system (DBMS).</p>
<h1>2) What are the advantages of a DBMS?</h1>
<p>A DBMS can improve your data processes and increase the business value of your organization's data assets,<br>
 freeing users across the organization from repetitive and time-consuming data processing tasks. The result?<br>
 A more productive workforce, better compliance with data regulations, and better decisions.</p>
<h1>3) What do you understand by Data Model</h1>
<h1>4) What is DDL ?</h1>
<p>A data definition language (DDL) is a computer language used to create and modify the structure of <br>
database objects in a database. These database objects include views, schemas, tables, indexes, etc</p>
<h1>5) Explain DML</h1>
<p>A DML (data manipulation language) refers to a computer programming language that allows you to add (insert),<br>
 delete (delete), and alter (update) data in a database.</p>

<h1>Tutorial - 03</h1>

<h1>1) Explain components of web</h1>
<p>Web Components are a set of features that provide a standard component model for the Web allowing for <br>
encapsulation and interoperability of individual HTML elements. Primary technologies used to create them include:<br>
 Custom Elements: APIs to define new HTML elements.</p>
<h1>2) Explain Attribute of table</h1>
<p>Each row (called a tuple) is a data set that applies to a single item, and each column contains characteristics that describe the rows. In database lingo, these columns are called attributes. A database attribute is a column name and the content of the fields under it in a table.</p>
<h1>3) What is textarea tags?</h1>
<p>The textarea tag defines a multi-line text input control. The textarea element is often used in a form,<br>
 to collect user inputs like comments or reviews. A text area can hold an unlimited number of characters, and the <br>
 text renders in a fixed-width font (usually Courier).</p>
<h1>4) Explain rules to declare variable</h1>
<p>All variable names must begin with a letter of the alphabet or an underscore(_). After the first initial letter, <br>
variable names can also contain letters and numbers. Variable names are case sensitive. No spaces or special characters <br>
are allowed,</p>

<h1>Tutorial - 04</h1>

<h1>1) Explain advantages of cyber law</h1>
<p>Cyber Laws yields legal recognition to electronic documents and a structure to support e-filing and e-commerce transactions <br>
and also provides a legal structure to reduce, check cyber crimes. Importance of Cyber Law: It covers all transactions over the<br>
 internet. It keeps eye on all activities over the internet.</p>
<h1>2) Explain "Ethics and Morals " in cyber law</h1>
<P>While they're closely related concepts, morals refer mainly to guiding principles, and ethics refer to specific rules and actions, or behaviors.</p>
<h1>3) Explain cyber crime with some examples of cyber crime</h1>
<p>ypes of cybercrime include: Email and internet fraud. Identity fraud (where personal information is stolen and used). Theft of financial or card payment data.</p>
<h1>4) How we can protect ourselves from cyber crime</h1>
<p>Don't repeat your passwords on different sites and change your passwords regularly. Make them complex. <br>
That means using a combination of at least 10 letters, numbers, and symbols. A password management application <br>
can help you to keep your passwords locked down.</p>
