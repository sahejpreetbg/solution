<h1> what are exams??</h1>
<p>An examination (exam or evaluation) or test is an educational assessment intended to measure a test-taker's knowledge, skill, <br>
aptitude, physical fitness, or classification in many other topics (e.g., beliefs).[1] A test may be administered verbally, on paper<br>
, on a computer, or in a predetermined area that requires a test taker to demonstrate or perform a set of skills.<br>

Tests vary in style, rigor and requirements. There is no general consensus or invariable standard for test formats and difficulty.<br>
 Often, the format and difficulty of the test is dependent upon the educational philosophy of the instructor, subject matter, class <br> 
 size, policy of the educational institution, and requirements of accreditation or governing bodies.<br>

A test may be administered formally or informally. An example of an informal test is a reading test administered by a parent <br> 
to a child. A formal test might be a final examination administered by a teacher in a classroom or an IQ test administered by a <br> 
psychologist in a clinic. Formal testing often results in a grade or a test score.[2] A test score may be interpreted with regards <br>
to a norm or criterion, or occasionally both. The norm may be established independently, or by statistical analysis of a large<br>
 number of participants.


A test may be developed and administered by an instructor, a clinician, a governing body, or a test provider. In some instances, the <br>developer of the test may not be directly responsible for its administration. For example, Educational Testing Service (ETS), <br>
a nonprofit educational testing and assessment organization, develops standardized tests such as the SAT but may not directly be involved in the administration or proctoring of these tests.
